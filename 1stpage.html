        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-5"><h2>WHY "CAR"??</h2></div>
      <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-5"><p>Well you may know what is car and might seen it many a time in your life but did you ever wonder why do we call it "car"
      only and not anything else.<br>So let explore it,actually the English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum "wheeled vehicle" or (via Old North French) Middle English carre "two-wheeled cart", both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros "chariot". It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.
"Motor car," attested from 1895, is the usual formal term in British English".Autocar", a variant likewise attested from 1895 and literally meaning "self-propelled car," is now considered archaic. "Horseless carriage" is attested from 1895.<br>
Now you know why is it called so.</p></div>
